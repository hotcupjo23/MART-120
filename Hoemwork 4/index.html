	<font color="#3498db">The fourth assignment&nbsp;took us from the less structured Scratch into the world of PlayLab and phone app&#39;s. I found this really interesting because we see a shift in how code goes from your home to your pocket. Phone&#39;s are tiny computers, so it only makes sense that they&#39;d function in a similar way to your desktop! I didn&#39;t really feel that connection until we started to this assignment&nbsp;in a less structured browser. This continued to help further my understanding of the hieroglyphs&nbsp;that is code.</font><br>
