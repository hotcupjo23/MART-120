	<font color="#3498db">The sixth assignment took the training wheels off completely as we learned a new language in a new format. I really enjoyed doing this project from start to finish. I confused myself a lot, but I was pretty proud of myself when I finished. This sort of taught me what it&#39;s like to design a website and how much work goes into the backend of it. Like gaming developers, I can see why people in those positions are so highly paid. &nbsp;Below I&#39;ve posted the code for homework 6.</font><br>

<title> About Me: Short Story </title>
<body>
<h1>About Me (the artist, I guess)</h1>
<p><strong> On this page, I've included a short story about my DJ alias Sweet Island!</strong></p>
<br />
</body>

<p> Sweet Island (that's my artist alias) was born in a small, rural cowboy town in Eastern Montana.</p>
<p> His first music class in elementary school would spark a life long passion for composition, sound, and music. He'd be in band classes for most of middle school and would become one of the first freshmen to join the elite senior choral group in high school. He'd go on to become an All-State Musician in choir singing and his passion would continue into college.</p>
<p> Sweet Island would purchase his first mixer after attending the Arise Arts and Music Festival in Loveland Colorado. A three-day festival that show cased art and new style of mixing and music he'd never been exposed too. Fueled by his curiousity of electronic sound and digital mastering, Sweet Island would begin mixing music in his dorm room, before playing greasy house parties throughout Missoula.</p>
<p> His love of music, passion for parties, and unique mixing style made him stand out in the Montana DJ scene. From house parties, to mountain parties, to bars, and to the stages of the Wilma.
<p> Sweet Island would open up the Socotra Festival in 2018 for Steve Aoki, and continues to be a force in the downtown music scene and underground festival scene around Montana. 
<p> Recently, Sweet Island had his vehicle broken into by a scum bag. He'd have nearly $2000 in audio equipiment stolen, including his laptop and perscription glasses. The police were no help and the passion to play had been crushed, but it is not the equipiment that makes the DJ or the sound.</p>
<p> It's the love of playing (what you do!) and since the great burglary, Sweet Island has returned to the downtown scene to do what he loves and to be more than the equipiment he owns. With over five years of experince in mixing, he's able to pick up any new deck or technology with familiarty and ease. </p>
