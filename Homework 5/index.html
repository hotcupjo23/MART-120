	<font color="#3498db">The fifth assignment loosened the training wheels. This is by far my favorite assignment to do. I loved getting to use the assets and toolkit they provided to us. Game development has always intrigued me the most so this gave me an in-depth look into how it&#39;s done. Super complicated and tedious in my opinion, so I have to give a round of applause to the programmers that make A+ games. &nbsp;</font><br>
