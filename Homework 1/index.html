	<span style="color:#3498db;">The first assignment we did was writing about the difference and similarities of GUI and CLI. Short of writing a second essay on what I learned, I&#39;ll paraphrase and provide a link to the essay itself. GUI and CLI both bring different tools to the digital table. They provide coders or programmers of varying skill levels the opportunity to either learn or stream line their work flow. One is not better than the other, so it&#39;s worthwhile to learn both-- coding language is super versatile and situational!</span>
