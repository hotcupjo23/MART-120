In this section we discussed mindsets, learning styles, and used an in-browser coding tool to make avatars dance!
//
I liked this section because we delved into how different people's brains are and the different styles of learning that come with that.
//
Using in the browser we were able to see how easy it is to learn code and it can be designed for almost any educational level. In this case we used a program that was designed for children to use. Lots of fun!
