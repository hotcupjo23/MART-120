	<font color="#3498db">The second assignment&nbsp;was about discussing mindsets, learning styles, and making a dance party! I liked this assignment&nbsp;a lot because of how it builds off the first one. Your mindset and how you approach problems kind of dictates your ability to problem solve. The way you learn influences&nbsp;your mindset because it&#39;s about what tools you have and how you learn that leads to how you solve the problem. Code in particular appeals to a diverse set of mindsets and learning styles. In fact code can be made so simple and easy that children can even do it. This was a fun assignment&nbsp;getting to see how education bleeds into technology! You even get a certificate for it!</font>
